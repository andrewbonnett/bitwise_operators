# bitwise_operators
CS 224 (Computer Systems) homework to practice using bitwise operators.

## Description
Answers practice problems 2.61, 2.69, 2.92, 2.94 from *Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective (3rd Edition)*. Each problem asks you to write a function that makes changes to the bits of an int or float that is passed. The catch is that you are limited to certain operators and language features when trying to solve each problem. The rules for the integer based problems are found on p129 for integers and p141 for floats.
